# ProjectSudoku
## Description
Final project for ICS3U, implementation of Sudoku logic game using Java and the [Processing](https://processing.org/) graphics library

## Game Description
Sudoku is a number puzzle on a 9×9 grid with a set of certain given numbers, and nine 3×3 sub-cells.
To solve the puzzle, one must place the numbers from 1 to 9 in the empty squares so that each row, column, and box has no repeated numbers.  
Due to computational limits, there is a chance that the puzzles created by this program have more than one solution.

## Controls:
- Select number using button panel, number keys, or scroll wheel.  
- Left click on an empty cell to add/remove a number.  
- Right click on an empty cell to add/remove a note.
