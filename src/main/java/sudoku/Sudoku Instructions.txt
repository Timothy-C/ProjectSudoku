Instructions:
A Sudoku is a number puzzle on a 9 x 9 grid with a set of certain given numbers, and nine 3 x 3 sub-cells. To solve the puzzle, one must place the numbers from 1 to 9 in the empty squares so that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box has no repeated numbers.

In our game, placing a number into the box is done by first selecting a number by clicking on one of the numbers in the grey box. After selecting a number, left-click on a cell(one that is not given when the grid was generated) to add a number, or right-click on a cell to add/remove a note.

When right-clicking, if there is no note on a cell(note is a possibility of what a number could be), there will be a note added to the cell with the selected number. If there already is a note with the selected number, the note will be removed.

When a cell is filled by a number, all notes will be removed. When a cell is filled by an invalid number, the cell will be highlighted red. Given cells, which are the cells that are filled when the board is generated, are always highlighted grey and cannot be edited by adding a number or a note.
