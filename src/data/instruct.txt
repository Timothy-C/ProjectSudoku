Instructions

Sudoku is a number puzzle on a 9×9 grid with a set of certain given numbers, and nine 3×3 sub-cells.
To solve the puzzle, one must place the numbers from 1 to 9 in the empty squares so that each row, column,
and box has no repeated numbers. Due to computational limits, there is a chance that the puzzles created
by this program have more than one solution.

Given cells, which are the cells that are filled when the board is generated, are always highlighted darker
than editable cells and cannot be modified by numbers or notes.

When hovering over a cell, all cells that may affect it are highlighted.
When a cell is filled by an invalid number, it and all conflicting cells are highlighted red.

All notes are removed when a number is placed into a cell.

Controls:
    Select number using button panel, number keys, or scroll wheel.
    Left click on an empty cell to add/remove a number.
    Right click on an empty cell to add/remove a note.
